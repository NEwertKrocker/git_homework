TAKEAWAYS
I've found some of the activities easy, and others difficult - I need to remember
that I'm going to have strengths and weaknesses as a developer, and I should probably
start to be aware of them and address them through practice and self-education.

Despite occasionally using the command line for various tasks, I never really
thought about it as performing the same fundamental tasks as Finder (or Windows
  Explorer). It always just struck me as some weird, eldritch magic meant for
  people who knew more than I did. It's nice to shed that fear a bit.

STRATEGIES
Going to try to practice some more pseudocoding so I can try and improve at that
skill.

Going to try to work using keyboard shortcuts as much as possible and only use
the touchpad when absolutely necessary.

SHOUTOUT
Shout out to Kyra B, who I've been in three different breakout groups with and
who has been very friendly and helpful!

SESSION THREE ADDITION
Hey! I'm here adding some more thoughts to this file in accordance with the
assignment in session three.

Thought one: Aren't fireflies neat?

Thought two: I could really go for a donut.

Thought three: You know I never watched Breaking Bad? Just not my cup of tea,
I guess.
