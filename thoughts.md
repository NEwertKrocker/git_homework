I've found some of the activities easy, and others difficult - I need to remember
that I'm going to have strengths and weaknesses as a developer, and I should probably
start to be aware of them and address them through practice and self-education.

Despite occasionally using the command line for various tasks, I never really
thought about it as performing the same fundamental tasks as Finder (or Windows
  Explorer). It always just struck me as some weird, eldritch magic meant for
  people who knew more than I did. It's nice to shed that fear a bit.
